This repo allows users to check their Steam library Linux compatibility    


It uses JSON calls to Steam's public API. To use the public API to gather a user's library information, you must register your domain with Steam to receive a key    

This key is stored in a file called CONFIG (not included in this repo) under the variable $steamkey    

Enjoy!
